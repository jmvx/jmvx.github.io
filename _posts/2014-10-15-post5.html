<p>A Quarter After Valentine's ("You Ask if I'd Like to Spend a Lonely Night With You? I'll Note the Oxymoron [Together Does Not Equal Alone], But Still Say Yes.")</p>

<p>You're lying in bed a little past midnight and you can't sleep. All you can think about is the rejection you recently received from an interviewer and all the things that could have been. How you could have lived in never-sleeping New York City. How you could have escaped your current job as a warehouse worker. How you could have done something different, something you could have possibly loved. How everything could have easily come together if the answer had only been "yes."</p>

<p>Just a few hours ago you spent the evening with your best-friend-roommate. For comfort and to celebrate the day, the two of you went out for ice cream, him choosing strawberry and you choosing cookies and cream.</p>

<p>But happy memories don't make you happy. Your roommate awakens to three knocks on his door and a request for him to come with you to your thinking tree.</p>

<p>The night is cloudy. But even then, you can still make out the Big Dipper and the dying moon. "There's no shade on the moon," your pal remarks. "Never a cloudy sky and never a tree to sit under."</p>

<p>"That's odd," you reply. But instead of thinking about your job, the moon, or the shade, all you can think about is how much you love your friend.</p>
