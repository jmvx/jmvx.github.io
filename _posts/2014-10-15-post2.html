<p>Finally finished the cat. Also took some pics of the dragon I did this summer. That dragon was incredibly hard to make because my origami book didn't have an entry for dragons, so I had to use the Korean instructions. I kinda made up my own way of making it, but I think it looks good. It has a swirly... swirl thing around it's snake like body, and a plastic pearl in its mouth. It's really fragile, so I'll probably not make it again.</p>
