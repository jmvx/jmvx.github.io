Samantha Cesario's fourth place program at Skate America (underscored,
which is one reason why I don't like figure skating [your marks are
often based off your reputation]):

Elizzveta Tuktamysheva's winning free skate at Cup of China (a really
solid program with really solid choreography):

Also her short program, because why not (it's a good interpretation of
Bolero): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sHQmw8wnB0

It should be noted that the Russian ladies currently have a really
deep field. Basically, it's like Japan's ladies field from around
2004-2010, where there are five or more women who are all vying for
one of three spots on a world/Olympic team, even though each
legitimately has a chance of medaling (more often than not, it comes
down to who can deliver at nationals).

To which I'll add, Julia Lipnitskaia's short program is also solid
this season: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Si7m5m3SjVs [Let's not
talk about her long program, where she pulled a Sasha Cohen (this is a
/bad/ comment, btw)]

I guess I can maintain this thread for figure skating-related videos
as they progress this season. I threw the idea to Julia and Kelly
about starting a figure skating blog, but I really don't have anything
substantial to write/comment about that other skating blogs aren't
already doing. I /could/ pull an Uncle Tim (he has a gymnastics blog)
and incorporate more "sexy data" (as he calls it) into figure skating
by analyzing scores and whatnot (score inflation as the season goes on
is apparent enough in figure skating, tbh), but I don't know if I'd
want to put the time into that.

blah blah figure skating blah blah. Hope you all are well!
