<p>Every Sunday at 11 a.m., residents of southeastern Connecticut can tune their radios to 94.9 WJJF-FM to listen to an hourlong show called "Win at Real Estate with Lori Hopkins-Cavanagh."</p>
<p>Although the station describes the show as "helping you navigate through the complex world of real estate," recent episodes have combined campaign speech and political promotion.</p>
<p>Host Hopkins-Cavanagh, a real estate broker who ran for mayor of New London in 2011, spent the entire Aug. 10 show discussing her ideology and her campaign to represent Connecticut's 2nd District in the U.S. House of Representatives.</p>
<p>"We can change what's happening in Washington, D.C., and Hartford by changing the people we send there," she told her listeners, after spending the first 9 minutes of her show describing problems with the current leadership.
