<p>Back in February, when a blizzard dumped 36 inches of snow on the town, residents hunkered down in their homes and waited for the town to plow their roads. Things were different on Maynard Road in Oakdale, where eight families worked in shifts throughout the night to clear the street.</p>
<p>"That was horrible," recalled resident Lynda Jean, who shoveled the snow while her neighbors used snowblowers and four wheelers. "We were at wit's end â€¦ you just try to get one path done and (the snow was) right back."</p>
<p>The town's Department of Public Works was praised by local officials for quickly clearing the roads, but the families living on Maynard Road knew not to expect a plow to come through. Their road was abandoned, apparently by mistake, during a five-minute town meeting in 1996.

<p>For more than a decade, Jean has been trying to get the town to admit - and correct - its mistake. And she hasn't gotten very far.</p>
