<p>In a decisive victory, voters returned U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney, D-2nd District, to Congress for a fifth term on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Courtney gave a speech to supporters at the Holiday Inn in Norwich around 10 p.m. At the time, he had not heard from his Republican opponent but said he was optimistic about results.</p>
<p>Republican Lori Hopkins-Cavanagh called him around 10:30 p.m. to concede the race, in which the Associated Press was reporting a 20-point Democratic lead.</p>
<p>Courtney, 61, emphasized that he “can point to real, concrete results” as a legislator and would never take the voters in the Second District for granted.</p>
