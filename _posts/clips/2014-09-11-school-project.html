<p>Board of Finance Chairman Dan Spring drew on his experience as a pilot on Tuesday to explain to a room of school and town officials why they should not be deterred from continuing work on the school project that has failed at referendum twice.</p>
<p>Passengers may be relaxing on a cross-country flight on a 747, but the pilot "is continually making corrections on that aircraft to get it from JFK to Los Angeles. Continually," he said during a joint meeting of the Boards of Education, Finance and Selectmen.</p>
<p>"Along the way, he's talking to air traffic control, he may have to go into holding pattern, he may have to change altitudes, he may have to go into an alternate, and that's all part of the continuum. And people still arrive in Los Angeles and don't know the difference."

<p>It was an optimistic look at a building project that school officials said they've been trying to get through for a decade and that, earlier this summer, resulted in several heated exchanges between members of the three boards. With no path forward, the boards convened Tuesday's joint meeting in an attempt to sort things out.</p>
