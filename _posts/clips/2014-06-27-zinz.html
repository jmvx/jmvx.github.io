<p>Emily Zinz, who was diagnosed with ocular melanoma shortly after turning 15, told her mother she had three goals: to meet the cast members of A&E's "Duck Dynasty," attend prom and graduate from high school.</p>
<p>The fall of her senior year, an administrator at Wheeler High School arranged a train trip to New York City, where Emily and her family met the TV show's bearded, camo-wearing cast and attended the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. In the spring, Emily put on a royal blue dress accented with rhinestones, got her hair and makeup done and hopped in a limo with her girlfriends to attend prom.</p>
<p>Last Thursday, she received her high school diploma. The following Sunday, she died.</p>
