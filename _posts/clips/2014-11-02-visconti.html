<p>Running in a virtual dead heat with incumbent Democratic Gov. Dannel P. Malloy, Republican challenger Tom Foley received a boost Sunday when petitioning candidate Joe Visconti dropped out of the race and threw his support behind Foley.</p>
<p>“I saw the race going the wrong way,” said Visconti, who had said last week that he would not leave the race.</p>
<p>But a Public Policy Polling poll released this weekend that showed Malloy ahead of Foley by 3 percentage points helped change his mind.</p>
<p>“When I saw the numbers, I knew what I had to do,” he said.
