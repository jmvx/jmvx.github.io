I find Javier Fernandez to be so so so so cute. *swoon*

Javier you are so perfect: http://davaistoi.tumblr.com/post/81105072957/javier-fernandez-talking-about-his-first#notes

I giggle whenever I think about him he is so damn cute.

Oh Javier, while I would normally hate the choreography and music
choice and groan at the multiple errors in the routine, you can pull
off this short program because of your hotness.

(I know Kelly and Julia already know, but I really, /really/ like
Javier Fernandez.)

Also, if you didn't know, this is the first season that figure skaters
(i.e., not ice dancers) are being allowed to use songs with lyrics in
their routines.

Javier Fernandez had a fan meet up after Cup of Russia (technically
Rostelecom Cup, but I prefer the old name). Anyway, clips!

Oh Javier, you're so cute. Why can't I be one of those giggling girls
at that table who adores everything you say and your glowing smile?

(Just, in your head, remove that facial hair from him.)
