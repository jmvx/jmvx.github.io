    Earlier this month, I visited your museum for a second time. My first visit was three years ago, and during that visit I noticed an error on one of your plaques honoring a notable Chinese-American. At that time, I brought attention of the mistake to someone at the front desk as well as sent an e-mail (to info@ and archives@mocanyc.org); unfortunately, I never heard back from anyone. Further unfortunately, I was disappointed to see the error had not been fixed three years later.

The mistake I am again bringing to your attention is on the Michelle Kwan plaque. The text states that Kwan has "eight consecutive and eight overall U.S. Championship titles (1996, 1998-2005)". This is wrong, since Kwan has won a total of nine overall U.S. Championship titles (the years are correct on the plaque, but I can see how the mistake was made). Doing a bit more research, I discovered the same error on a U.S. Figure Skating Association profile of Kwan (http://www.usfsa.org/AthleteBio.asp?id=2267), but it later contradicts itself by saying Kwan has "nine career U.S. titles" as opposed to the "eight overall" mentioned in the first line of the "Notes" section.

To me, this is a very important error that should be fixed. While it may seem like docking one championship from a relatively big number (nine titles is many titles won in figure skating), Kwan having a total number of nine championship wins ties her (with Maribel Vison) for the most number of U.S. nationals won; saying that she has only won eight means that she loses this important distinction. To put it in a sports analogy, saying Kwan won eight U.S. Championships is like saying the Pittsburgh Steelers won five Super Bowls (both are incorrect and would make the winners lose a special distinction).

I am aware that correcting errors can be costly (i.e., Who wants to pay to fix something?), but I was thinking you could at the very least place a sticker over the number "eight" and put "nine" over it.

I hope to hear from someone this time. Again, though, I had a pleasant and educating time visiting your museum.

Dear Michael Chu,

 

Thank you very much for your email, and I’m sorry no one had emailed before. I’ve brought this to the attention of our curatorial staff and they are going to see about a correction for the plaque. As you stated, correcting errors can be costly, especially on those plaques. But it is important that we have the correct information as well, especially were Ms. Kwan to visit the museum!

 

Thank you so much for your input
