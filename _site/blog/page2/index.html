  <span class="date">October 15, 2014 </span>
  <hr />
  Earlier this month, I visited your museum for a second time. My first visit was three years ago, and during that visit I noticed an error on one of your plaques honoring a notable Chinese-American. At that time, I brought attention of the mistake to someone at the front desk as well as sent an e-mail (to info@ and archives@mocanyc.org); unfortunately, I never heard back from anyone. Further unfortunately, I was disappointed to see the error had not been fixed three years later.

  This guy is playing my favorite Scott Joplin Rag (Pine Apple Rag), and he's doing it on an /accordion/. It's so good!

  <span class="date">October 15, 2014 </span>
  <hr />
  <p>Once, there was a yellow bird who lived in a small pet store in Greenwich Village. Like all the animals in the store, he longed for a human to take him home. After all, there was something different about being taken care of by an owner rather than Petco staff; the bird, like all the other animals, longed for human love.</p>

  <span class="date">October 15, 2014 </span>
  <hr />
  <p>Finally finished the cat. Also took some pics of the dragon I did this summer. That dragon was incredibly hard to make because my origami book didn't have an entry for dragons, so I had to use the Korean instructions. I kinda made up my own way of making it, but I think it looks good. It has a swirly... swirl thing around it's snake like body, and a plastic pearl in its mouth. It's really fragile, so I'll probably not make it again.</p>

  <p>Everything here is pretty much perfection (excluding the step on
dismount). Bai Yawen's leaps are textbook. Her acrobatic elements are
a bit weaker, but it's really refreshing to see an athlete with such
flexibility and toe point.</p>
