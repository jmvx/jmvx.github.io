<p>Ellen Gottfried's condo does not look as if it would be home to a 10-year-old.</p> <p>It's decorated in white and pastel tones, with lace doilies on wooden furniture and a china cabinet with antique dishes stored behind glass. An elderly black-and-white cat named Princess curls up on the couch and purrs deeply.</p> <p>But sitting across from Princess and the 66-year-old Gottfried is Mahogany Hampton, age 10, wearing flip-flops and summery clothing and fake nails painted...
