    <i>Why do you love me in the rain?</i>

<p>8 am weekdays. Like clockwork, you're always at the front of the platform, waiting to board my train. Today there's a downpour, but you're ready with your rainbow-colored umbrella. The train stops. I wave. You smile, a welcome response that brightens my day. If only I knew your name.</p>

<p>You always wave at me from the front of the train wearing your cute conductor hat and uniform. Yesterday it was raining and I wasn't in the mood to go to work, but seeing your friendly greeting made my day like it always does. If only we could meet.</p>
