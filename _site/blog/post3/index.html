            Yellow Bird and Tortoise

    <p>Once, there was a yellow bird who lived in a small pet store in Greenwich Village. Like all the animals in the store, he longed for a human to take him home. After all, there was something different about being taken care of by an owner rather than Petco staff; the bird, like all the other animals, longed for human love.</p>

<p>But human love didn't come soon enough. The yellow bird felt like he was in his cage forever, and felt like he would never be elsewhere than this Petco. When he thought about this, he began to cry.</p>

<p>"What's wrong?", asked a gentle voice.</p>

<p>Looking down, the yellow bird noticed a small fish tank. Inside was the wise tortoise that he always liked but was always too shy to talk to.</p>

<p>"I feel like I'll never be loved," said the yellow bird.</p>

<p>"And why do you think that?", asked the tortoise.</p>

<p>"Because I've been here forever, and no one has purchased me yet."</p>

<p>"Just because you are still here does not mean you are not loved. I have been here for many years and have seen many animals come and go, but before they went off to better homes they were my friends. And with friendship comes love. So for now, let me extend my love to you."</p>

<p>The yellow bird didn't quite know what to say at first. But he realized what the tortoise had to say was genuine, and the two started their friendship.</p>

<p>Days passed without either being adopted, but the two would talk for hours and hours. What it felt like to fly, what it felt like to swim, what it must be like to be in the outside world. And one day, a young boy and girl came in.</p>

<p>"I want a bird," said the girl. "I want a tortoise," said the boy. And it was such luck that, like destiny, both the yellow bird and the tortoise got adopted into the same home. And with that, the two continued their love in their new home for many years to come.</p>
