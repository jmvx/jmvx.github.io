<p>For more than 30 years, Palmer Academy has been providing another option for Montville teens who struggle to stay engaged in the traditional high school environment. The small program - with fewer than 30 students, three full-time teachers, two paraprofessionals and a social worker - allows staff to try out new approaches to education and give kids the kind of individualized attention they can't get at Montville High School.</p>
